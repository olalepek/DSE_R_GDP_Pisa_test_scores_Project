# DSE_R_GDP_Pisa_test_scores_Project
Repository for the project verifying correlation between PISA Science Test Cores and GDP per capita for the countries represented in the World Bank Database for 2015. 

Background
UNESCO The Education 2030 Framework for Action Expenditure on Education as % of GDP indicator was chosen as: “ a key benchmark for a government financing of education, allocating at least 4% to 6% of its GDP. The indicator also reflects the commitment of a government to invest in human capital development”.
PISA test, measures 15-year-olds’ ability to use their reading, mathematics and science knowledge and skills to meet real-life challenges.

Conclusions
Expenditure on education as a % of GDP impact on PISA Science Test Scores failed to reject null hypothesis - that those idnicators are not corralated - for regression models used in the analysis.

GDP per capita and PISA test scores shown meaningful relationship for both supervised and unsupervised models.
Secondary students from countries with higher GDP per capita on average where having higher results on PISA Science Test, no matter the governmental expenditure on education (as % of GDP)
